# Electoral Atlas 

* From direct democracy to democratic tecnhocracy (we'll always assume democratic regime)

* Top-down vs. bottom-up (pure content-based or content+confidence-based vs. pure confidence-based)

* Graph-based vs. non graph-based (ML s.a. K-means, ...)

* Centrality-based ranking for graph-based systems (spectral vs. non-spectral: Map eqation, PageRank, ...)
* Community Detection for party formation (G-N, Modularityl, Map Equation, Clustering...)

* Parameters: 
    * *N*: Voter population size (fixed by current law)
    * *M*: Candidate population size (Exogenous vs. Endogenous)
    * *K*: Representative population size 

* Representative Ranking:
    * Party-based / Aggregated
    * Individual-based 

* Implement all or most of currently realized models (first-past-the-post, preferences, majority, proportial,...)
* Build models with pre-electoral party dogma.

* Experiments with epirica.ly and other tools.
