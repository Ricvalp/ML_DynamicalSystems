\section{Logistic map}
Starting from $x_{n+1}=rf(x_{n})$, the idea is to plot $x_{n}$ vs. $n$ for different $r$ (and different $x_{0}$) to show the behavior for large n. Then, I would like to produce an animation of the bifurcation diagram: asymptotic values of $x$ vs. $r$.
\section{Feigenbaum constatnt}
The idea is to numerically calculate the Feigenbaum constant and show that it is the same for different $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ provided they satisfy certain conditions.
\section{ Mandelbrot set}
Show the correspondence between the Mandelbrot set and the bifurcation diagram
